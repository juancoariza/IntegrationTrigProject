  /* A 2D array is an array that can store values in two directions: 
   * the x-axis (rows) and the y-axis (columns). This format creates a matrix 
   * of values for multiple operations, though in general use 2D arrays are 
   * most often created for dependent values. 2D arrays also serve as the 
   * groundwork for Maps in Java, which have their own specialties*/
